# PT Champion Web Frontend Performance Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates performance analysis findings and provides an actionable implementation plan to improve page load times and transitions in the PT Champion web application. The analysis identified several key areas for optimization including asset loading, data fetching patterns, React rendering inefficiencies, and bundle size issues.

## Current State Overview

### Strengths
- Code splitting via React.lazy for route-based loading
- TanStack React Query for server state management with 5-minute cache times
- Service Worker implementation for offline support
- Compression enabled (gzip and brotli)
- Manual vendor chunk splitting (react, ui, query, mediapipe)

### Key Performance Issues

1. **Large Unoptimized Assets**: 5.7MB+ of images including 1.4-1.5MB logo PNGs
2. **Eager MediaPipe Model Loading**: Pose detection initialized on app startup regardless of usage
3. **Inefficient Data Fetching**: Dashboard fetches all workout pages sequentially
4. **React Performance Anti-patterns**: Missing memoization, inline functions, large components
5. **Aggressive Cache Busting**: Service worker forces re-download of static assets
6. **Missing Modern Optimizations**: No lazy loading, responsive images, or CDN usage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)

#### 1.1 Image Optimization ✅ COMPLETED
- **Convert logo PNGs to SVG or WebP** ✅ (93% size reduction achieved!)
  - `logo_colored.png`, `logo_gold.png`, `logo_white.png` - Reduced from 1.4-1.5MB to 88-99KB
  - Implemented WebP with PNG fallback via new OptimizedImage component
- **Remove unused signin assets** ✅ (500+ redundant files removed)
- **Implement native lazy loading** ✅ for images: Added `loading="lazy"` to OptimizedImage
- **Add responsive images** using srcSet for different screen sizes (TODO in Phase 4)
- **Additional optimization**: Converted exercise images (pushup, pullup, situp, running) from 785KB-1.3MB to 35-71KB

#### 1.2 React Performance Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
- **Add React.memo to list components** ✅:
  - `WorkoutHistoryRow` ✅
  - `EnhancedLeaderboardRow` (was LeaderboardRow) ✅
  - `WorkoutCard` ✅ (also updated to use WebP images)
  - `LeaderboardRowSkeleton` ✅
- **Extract inline onClick handlers** to useCallback in ✅:
  - `Dashboard.tsx` ✅ (all navigation handlers extracted)
  - `Leaderboard.tsx` (lines 214-228, 242, 272) (TODO - Phase 1 continuation)
  - `History.tsx` (filter button handlers) (TODO - Phase 1 continuation)
- **Memoize expensive computations** ✅:
  - Date formatting in `Dashboard.tsx` ✅ (memoized inline date calculations)
  - Exercise links and rubric options arrays ✅ (both memoized)
  - Updated Dashboard to use OptimizedImage component for all images

#### 1.3 Console Logging Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implemented proper logger utility** ✅ that respects production/development environments
- **Updated critical files** ✅:
  - App.tsx - Updated console.error to use logger
  - Leaderboard.tsx - Updated console.log to use logger.debug
  - PushupTracker.tsx - Updated all console statements to use logger
  - Dashboard.tsx already uses logger properly
- **Logger automatically disables debug logs in production** ✅
- Service Worker files kept console logs (intentional for debugging)
- Additional files can be updated as needed during development

### Phase 2: Data Fetching Optimization (2-3 weeks)

#### 2.1 Dashboard Performance
- **Create backend aggregation endpoint** for dashboard metrics
  - Replace client-side loop fetching all run pages
  - Single API call for average run time and other stats
- **Implement background data fetching**:
  - Show available data immediately
  - Update metrics asynchronously as they load

#### 2.2 API Efficiency
- **Add server-side filtering** for history and leaderboard
- **Implement proper pagination** instead of fetching all data
- **Add request deduplication** to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Enable API response compression** (gzip/brotli)

#### 2.3 Optimistic Updates
- Implement optimistic updates for:
  - Workout submissions
  - Profile updates
  - Settings changes

### Phase 3: Asset Loading & Bundle Optimization (3-4 weeks)

#### 3.1 Lazy Load Pose Detection
- **Defer MediaPipe initialization** until exercise page entry
- Move `poseDetectorService.initialize()` from `App.tsx` to exercise components
- Use dynamic imports: `const PoseDetector = lazy(() => import('./services/PoseDetectorService'))`
- Consider using `requestIdleCallback` for preloading after initial render

#### 3.2 Optimize Polling & State Updates
- **Reduce PoseContext polling frequency** from 500ms to 2000ms
- Replace polling with event-driven updates where possible
- Increase tracker view-model sync interval from 100ms to 500ms
- Use RxJS pose stream for push-based updates

#### 3.3 MediaPipe Model Optimization
- **Use lite model by default** instead of full BlazePose model
- **Move models to CDN** with proper caching headers
- **Implement progressive model loading** with quality options
- Cache models in IndexedDB for offline use
- Add loading progress indicators

#### 3.4 Service Worker Caching Strategy
- **Remove aggressive cache busting** for hashed static assets
- Implement cache-first strategy for versioned bundles
- Use stale-while-revalidate for non-critical resources
- Avoid clearing entire cache on SW activation
- Keep instant updates only for critical security fixes

### Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (4-6 weeks)

#### 4.1 Critical CSS & Resource Hints
- **Extract and inline critical CSS** for above-the-fold content
- Add resource hints:
  - `<link rel="preload">` for critical fonts and scripts
  - `<link rel="prefetch">` for likely next-page resources
  - `<link rel="preconnect">` for API and CDN domains

#### 4.2 Component Splitting & Virtualization
- **Split large components**:
  - `History.tsx` (820 lines) → Chart, Table, Filter components
  - `Profile.tsx` (656 lines) → UserInfo, Stats, Settings
  - `RunningTracker.tsx` (625 lines) → UI, State, Business Logic
- **Implement list virtualization** using react-window for:
  - Workout history list
  - Leaderboard table
  - Exercise selection grid

#### 4.3 Heavy Library Optimization
- **Lazy load chart components** with placeholder
- **Defer Leaflet map** until running workout starts
- **Code-split Recharts** into separate chunk
- Verify tree-shaking removes unused Lucide icons

#### 4.4 Advanced Asset Strategy
- **Set up image optimization pipeline**:
  - Automatic WebP/AVIF conversion
  - Multiple resolution generation
  - CDN integration
- **Implement global CDN** for all static assets
- **Consider edge computing** for pose model inference

### Phase 5: Infrastructure & Monitoring (Ongoing)

#### 5.1 Performance Monitoring
- Implement Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Add performance marks for key user journeys
- Set up Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Create performance budget alerts

#### 5.2 Build Pipeline Optimization
- Add bundle size analysis to CI/CD
- Implement automatic performance regression testing
- Set up Lighthouse CI for pull requests
- Create performance dashboard

## Implementation Notes

1. **Testing Strategy**: Each optimization should be A/B tested in production to measure actual impact
2. **Rollback Plan**: Use feature flags for major changes to enable quick rollbacks
3. **Browser Support**: Ensure optimizations maintain compatibility with target browsers
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement optimizations that gracefully degrade for older browsers

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed tickets for each Phase 1 item
2. Set up performance monitoring baseline
3. Prioritize based on current user pain points
4. Begin with image optimization and React performance fixes
5. Schedule weekly performance review meetings
