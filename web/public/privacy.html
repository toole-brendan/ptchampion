  <h1>PT Champion Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 16, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to PT Champion. This Privacy Policy explains how PT Champion ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (including the iOS app distributed via TestFlight) and our website (ptchampion.ai). By using the PT Champion app or website, you agree to the practices described in this policy. We are committed to data minimization and only collect what is necessary for the app's core functionality. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. This policy outlines what data we collect, how we use and safeguard it, your rights regarding your data, and platform-specific disclosures.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you register for PT Champion, we collect personal identifiers such as your first name, last name, email address, and a chosen username. You must create an account with this information to use the app's features. This data is used to identify you, set up your user profile, and manage your account (for example, to log in and sync your data across devices).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Fitness and Activity Data:</strong> When you use PT Champion to track exercises, we collect data about your workouts and performance. This includes details like the type of exercise, number of repetitions, duration or time, scores/grades for your performance, and other metrics (e.g. pace or form quality). If you connect external fitness devices or sensors, we also collect data from those — for example, heart rate data from a Bluetooth heart rate monitor or distance and pace from a GPS running watch. These fitness metrics help us provide you with real-time feedback, performance analysis, and progress tracking.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> With your permission, we may collect your approximate location (GPS latitude/longitude) from your device. Location data is only collected in specific situations to support certain features – for example, to track your routes and calculate distance/pace during running workouts, or to show "local" leaderboards of users in your vicinity. Location collection is optional and only active when you are using location-based features; the app will request your consent for location access ("Allow While Using App"), and you can decline or disable location permission at any time. We do not collect location information in the background when you are not actively using a location feature.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Camera and Sensor Data:</strong> With your consent, the app accesses your device's camera to enable our computer vision-based exercise tracking. For example, PT Champion uses your camera to count push-up or sit-up repetitions and analyze your form in real-time. The video feed from your camera is processed on your device to derive fitness metrics; we do not store or upload the actual video/images to our servers. Similarly, if you choose to use other device sensors (like your phone's accelerometer or a connected Bluetooth sensor), those inputs (e.g. motion data or heart rate readings) are collected only to facilitate the app's functionality during your workout. Sensor data is not used for any purpose other than computing your exercise results and providing feedback to you.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Technical Usage Data:</strong> When you use our app or website, we may collect certain technical information automatically. This includes data such as your device type and operating system, browser type (for the website), IP address, and usage logs (e.g. timestamps of logins or workout sync events). We collect this data to maintain the security and normal operation of the service, to debug issues, and to understand aggregate usage patterns. This technical data is generally not linked to your identity, except as needed to ensure our systems and your account remain secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes in line with the principle of purpose limitation (using data only for stated purposes):</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide and Improve the Service:</strong> We use your personal and fitness data to create and maintain your user account, authenticate you when you log in, and deliver core app features. For example, we use your registration details to log you in and sync your data, and we use your workout data to display your exercise history and performance metrics. The data allows us to calculate your scores, provide real-time feedback during exercises, and show your progress over time. We also may analyze aggregated, non-identifiable data to improve PT Champion's features and user experience.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Sync Across Devices and Backup:</strong> PT Champion is a cross-platform system. Your data is stored locally on your device for quick access and offline use, and periodically synchronized with our secure backend servers so that you can access your updated workouts and profile from any device (or the web) when you log in. This cross-device synchronization ensures a seamless experience and also serves as a backup of your data in case you lose access to your device. For example, if you log a workout on your phone while offline, the app will save it locally and then upload (sync) that workout to your account on our server when you reconnect to the internet.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Fitness Feedback and Analytics:</strong> We process your fitness and sensor data to give you meaningful feedback. This includes analyzing camera input to count reps and assess form, calculating performance metrics (like calories, scores, or grades), and compiling your data into charts or personal stats. If you enable location tracking for a run, we use your GPS data to calculate distance and pace and possibly map your route (within the app). If you use a heart rate monitor, we integrate your heart rate readings to show you training intensity. All of this processing is done to fulfill the app's purpose as your personal training companion and is not used for any unrelated profiling or advertising.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Leaderboards and Social Features:</strong> If you choose to participate in leaderboards, we will use certain data (like your exercise scores or running times) and, if applicable, your general location (e.g. city or region) to rank your performance against other users. For example, we might show that you are in the top 10 for push-ups globally, or within a 50-mile radius of your location for a local leaderboard. Location-based rankings are entirely optional and based on your granted location permission. We do not reveal your exact location to other users – only that you are part of a certain area's leaderboard. Your personal identity on leaderboards is limited to your display name or username.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We may use your email address to send you important account-related communications. This includes things like verification emails, password reset emails, notifications about significant changes to our service or this privacy policy, or customer support responses if you contact us. We will not send you marketing emails unrelated to PT Champion without your consent. (If in the future we introduce a newsletter or promotional updates, such communications will be optional and you will be able to opt-out.)</li>
    
    <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Technical information (such as IP addresses and device identifiers) may be used to help monitor for unusual or unauthorized activity on your account. This helps us protect against fraud, abuse, or unauthorized logins. If we detect login attempts from new devices or multiple failed logins, for example, we might log that information or alert you for security purposes. We also use data in aggregate to improve security (for instance, understanding common patterns in errors or crashes to fix them).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>We strictly limit the use of data to these purposes. We do not use your data for advertising profiling, nor do we share it with advertisers or data brokers. All processing of personal data is done in accordance with the purposes described to you and with your consent when required.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security Practices</h2>
  <p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement industry-standard safeguards to protect your information. Your data is stored in two places: on your device (local storage) and on our secure servers.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Device Storage:</strong> PT Champion stores data on your device to enable offline use and quick access. For example, your recent workouts and performance history may be cached in local storage (on iOS we use secure storage mechanisms like Apple's SwiftData/CoreData for offline data). This means you can review your data even without internet connectivity, and the app will sync with the server when a connection is available. Sensitive information such as authentication tokens (used to keep you logged in) are stored securely using the iOS Keychain and similar secure storage, so that other apps cannot read them. We do not store your plaintext password on the device or elsewhere – passwords are only used to authenticate and are then either hashed or discarded from memory.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Server Storage (Backend):</strong> We also store your data on our backend servers to support account functionality. This includes your profile information (name, email, etc.) and fitness records. Our backend is powered by a secure cloud database (we use a PostgreSQL database hosted in a secure environment). Data transmitted between the app and our servers is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS encryption (as required for App Store compliance), preventing eavesdropping. On the server, personal data is stored in an access-controlled database. We follow best practices for security: for instance, user passwords are hashed (encrypted one-way) before storage, and database backups are encrypted. Our infrastructure uses firewalls and regular security updates to protect against external threats. We also utilize authentication tokens and server-side validation to ensure that only you (when logged in) can access or modify your data.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to personal data in our system is limited. Only authorized personnel or processes (for example, the server processes handling your requests) can access the data, and even then only what is necessary to perform their function. We log administrative access to the databases and monitor for any unauthorized access. In development and testing, we use dummy data or scrubbed data whenever possible to avoid exposing real user information.</li>
    
    <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not share your personal information with third parties except as needed to operate the service. We do not sell data to advertisers, and we do not use third-party analytics services that would siphon off your data for marketing. The only third parties that may come into contact with your data are our service providers – for example, our cloud hosting provider (which provides the servers and database), or an email delivery service for sending account emails. These providers are bound by contracts to only use your data at our direction and to protect it. We ensure any such partners have strong security practices and we share only the minimum information necessary. Aside from such service providers acting on our behalf, your data is never disclosed to any outside company or organization unless we are legally required to (for example, to comply with a lawful subpoena or to protect our rights if the situation demands).</li>
    
    <li><strong>Data Security Measures:</strong> We employ a range of security measures to guard your data. This includes encryption of sensitive data (both in transit with SSL and at rest on our servers), regular security audits and testing, and a backup system for data redundancy. We monitor the app and servers for potential vulnerabilities or attacks. If we ever identify a security breach that affects your personal data, we will notify you as required by applicable law and take prompt action to remediate the issue.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>While no system can be 100% secure, we strive to use best practices and continually improve our safeguards to ensure your data remains protected. We also encourage you to keep your account secure by using a strong password and protecting access to your devices.</p>

  <h2>User Rights and Data Access</h2>
  <p>We believe you should have control over your personal data. Subject to applicable laws, you have the following rights regarding the information we hold about you:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> You have the right to access the personal data we have about you. In the app, you can view your profile information (name, email) and all your logged workouts and performance metrics. If you require a copy of your data in a portable format (for example, if you want a download of your workout history), you can contact us to request it. We can provide your data in a common format (such as JSON or CSV) for your own use.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Correction (Rectification):</strong> If any of your personal information is inaccurate or outdated, you have the right to correct it. You can update your profile details (such as your name or email) directly within the app's account settings (we provide an edit profile feature). If you have trouble updating any information, you can contact support, and we will help make the correction promptly. We want to ensure that your data is accurate and up-to-date.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Deletion (Right to Erasure):</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your account and personal data. We plan to provide an in-app account deletion option that will permanently remove your personal information and workout data from our main systems. Until such automated feature is available, you may contact us to request account deletion, and we will manually delete your data. When you delete your account, we will remove your identifiable personal data from our production database (though anonymous, aggregate data like overall usage statistics that do not identify you may be retained). Please note that due to backups and caching, complete removal from all systems (especially backups) may take a short period in accordance with our data retention policy (see Data Retention below), but we will not use your data after deletion request except to fulfill the deletion.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> If certain data processing is based on your consent (for example, using your location or connecting a third-party device), you have the right to withdraw that consent. You can do so by disabling the permission (turn off location or Bluetooth access in your device settings) or disconnecting the device. If you withdraw consent for a particular feature, we will stop collecting or processing the data related to that feature. For instance, if you previously allowed location but then revoke it, the app will simply not use location for runs or leaderboards going forward.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Restriction of Processing:</strong> You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances – for example, if you contest the accuracy of data or object to us processing it. Practically, if such a situation arises, you can contact us and we can pause any non-essential use of your data until resolved. In the app, if you want to pause data collection, you could simply refrain from using certain features (like turn off the tracking features) – the app only collects data when you actively use it. We do not otherwise process your data in ways beyond what's described, so restriction would generally coincide with either withdrawing consent or requesting deletion.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Object to Processing:</strong> In the event we ever engaged in any direct marketing or profiling (which we currently do not), you would have the right to object to that. As of now, we do not send marketing communications without consent or perform any automated decision-making that would significantly affect you. Should that change, you would have the right to opt out. You also have the right to object to processing for research or statistical purposes in certain cases. We will honor such objections as required by law.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> If you exercise any of the above rights (such as opting out of data collection or requesting deletion), we will not discriminate against you or deny you services. However, please understand that some functionality of the app requires certain data. For example, if you request deletion of your account, you will no longer be able to log in or use the app without creating a new account. If you turn off location access, you simply won't have the location-based features, but can continue using other parts of the app normally.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These rights may vary depending on your jurisdiction (for example, users in the European Union and California have specific rights under GDPR and CCPA, respectively). PT Champion's policy is to extend fundamental privacy rights to all our users where feasible. If you have any questions or wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us (see Contact Information below). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law. For certain requests, we may need to verify your identity to protect your security (e.g., verify that the email request actually comes from the owner of the account).</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In practice:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Active Account Data:</strong> For as long as you have an active account with PT Champion, we will retain the personal information you have provided (such as name and email) and the fitness data you generate in the app. Keeping this data is necessary so you can continue to access your history and use the app's features over time. This is also in line with the storage limitation principle – we keep data only as long as needed for the service.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you request to delete your account (or if we decide to remove inactive accounts as part of cleanup policies), we will delete your personal data from our live databases. Once deleted, you will no longer be able to access that account or its data. However, please note that complete removal from all systems will occur in the following ways:
      <ul>
        <li>We may retain a record of your deletion request and basic information for legal compliance or record-keeping (e.g., to prove that we deleted your data as requested, or information needed for security/fraud prevention).</li>
        <li>Your data may continue to exist in encrypted backups or archives for a certain period until those backups are rotated out and overwritten. Our database backups are retained for a limited time (e.g., backups may be kept for up to 90 days as part of our disaster recovery plan). Any data in backups is stored securely and is not actively processed or accessed once your account is deleted, except if needed for a disaster recovery restoration (in which case we would still honor the deletion and immediately re-delete the data). After the retention period, backup data containing your personal information will be destroyed or anonymized.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> If your account remains inactive for an extended period, we may contact you to ask if you wish to maintain it. We currently do not have a fixed policy to auto-delete inactive accounts, but we reserve the right to delete accounts that have not been used for several years, after due notice. We will update this policy if we formalize an inactivity deletion timeframe.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Fitness Data Storage:</strong> You may delete individual workout entries or other fitness logs in the app if you no longer want them (feature permitting). Deleting a specific workout will remove it from your account's current data set, though it may persist in backup snapshots until those are cycled out. We treat such user-generated content similarly to personal data for retention purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Overall, we aim to retain data only for as long as it's needed to serve you and to comply with our legal obligations. When data is no longer necessary, we either delete it or anonymize it so it can no longer be associated with you. Anonymized data (stripped of personal identifiers) may be retained for longer for purposes like statistical analysis or improvements to our service, but not in a form that would identify you.</p>

  <h2>Platform-Specific Disclosures</h2>
  <p>We provide the following additional information specific to the platforms on which PT Champion is offered:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>iOS App (including TestFlight Beta):</strong> The PT Champion iOS application requests access to certain device features to enable its functionality:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used to track and analyze your exercise form and count repetitions via computer vision. The camera is only active during exercise tracking sessions that require it (e.g., when you initiate a workout that uses the camera). No photos or videos are saved to your camera roll or sent to our servers – the image processing occurs in real-time on your device, and we only record the resulting exercise metrics (like rep counts or form scores), not the images themselves. You can choose not to grant camera access, but then camera-based exercise tracking features will be disabled. The app's camera usage is solely for providing feedback to you on your exercises.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Used to track running distance/pace and to enable local leaderboard comparisons. We only collect location data when you have granted permission and are actively using a feature that needs location (for example, starting a run tracking activity or viewing a local leaderboard). Location data is used to compute fitness metrics (like run route, distance, speed) and to aggregate your performance relative to a geographic area (for leaderboards). It is not used for any other purpose or shared. If you deny or revoke location permission, the app will continue to function but without the location-based features. You can always control location access through your iPhone Settings.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Bluetooth and Health Sensors:</strong> If you choose to connect external sensors such as a heart rate monitor or GPS watch via Bluetooth, the app will access Bluetooth to communicate with those devices. This allows PT Champion to collect data like your heart rate or additional workout metrics from the device to enhance your tracking. The first time a connection is needed, iOS will prompt you for Bluetooth permission (and the app's settings will list PT Champion under Bluetooth permissions). We do not use Bluetooth for any purpose other than connecting to user-approved fitness devices. Additionally, PT Champion may integrate with Apple's HealthKit in the future (if we add that, we will update this policy accordingly), but currently all health data is collected directly through the app or connected devices as described. Any HealthKit integration would abide by Apple's guidelines, meaning data would not be used for marketing or shared without explicit consent.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> (If applicable) The app may ask to send you push notifications – for example, to remind you of workouts or notify you of achievements. Granting notification permission is optional and can be managed in iOS settings. We would only send you relevant and minimal notifications, not marketing spam.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In all cases on iOS, we comply with Apple's requirements for user privacy. The app's Info.plist contains usage descriptions for the camera, location, and Bluetooth, which clearly state why the app needs these permissions. We encourage you to review those prompts carefully and only grant access if you feel comfortable. If you are testing the app via TestFlight, be assured that your data is handled in accordance with this same privacy policy. TestFlight beta data (including any feedback you submit) is used only to improve the app and is subject to the same protections outlined here. We make no distinction between beta testers and general users in terms of data handling – your information will not be treated as experimental data; it's protected just the same.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Website and Web Application:</strong> Our website ptchampion.ai (and any web-based application interface for PT Champion) collects generally the same categories of information as the mobile app when you use it. For example, if you register or log in on the website, we will collect your name, email, and password just as in the mobile app. If you perform workouts via a web interface (the web version also supports exercise tracking), similar fitness data will be collected. The web app might request access to your camera or location through the browser if you choose to use features that require them (for instance, using your webcam for form analysis via our Web MVP) – the browser will prompt you for permission, and the usage of camera or location on the web is analogous to the mobile app's use (data is used for functionality and not stored server-side beyond the workout results, and you can decline access). Our website may use IndexedDB or local storage in your browser for offline support (so you can use it as a Progressive Web App that works offline). This local storage on the browser works similarly to the mobile app's local data storage, keeping your workout logs on your device and syncing when online. We do not use any third-party analytics or advertising cookies on our website at this time – meaning we do not have Google Analytics, Facebook pixels, or ad networks tracking you on ptchampion.ai. The only cookies or local storage used are for technical purposes like maintaining your login session and enabling offline functionality. Standard web server logs are kept (which include IP addresses and page requests) for security and troubleshooting, as mentioned earlier, but these are only accessible to us and our hosting provider. If in the future we introduce analytics, we will update this policy and ensure any tracking is privacy-friendly and opt-in.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In summary, regardless of platform, the same fundamental privacy principles apply: we collect only what we need for you to enjoy the app, we are transparent about permissions (camera, location, etc.), and we do not send your sensitive data anywhere it doesn't need to be. Platform-specific features (like iOS-specific device features or web storage) are handled with care for your privacy.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>PT Champion is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years old. Our service is designed for adult users and teens interested in fitness (for example, military personnel or fitness enthusiasts). During registration, we may ask for age or confirmation that you are above the minimum age. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13 (or under the applicable age of consent in your region) without proper parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. Parents or guardians who believe that their child has provided us with personal information without consent should contact us so we can remove the data. We abide by laws like COPPA which govern children's privacy online, and as noted in our compliance documentation, we have measures (such as age verification in registration flow) to avoid collecting data from minors.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services or legal requirements evolve. If we make material changes, we will notify you by means of an in-app notice or by email (to the address associated with your account) prior to the change becoming effective. We will also update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy when you use PT Champion to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Continued use of the app or website after any modifications to the policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree with any updates to the policy, you should stop using the services and can request deletion of your data as described above.</p>

  <h2>Contact Information</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your personal data, please contact us at:</p>
