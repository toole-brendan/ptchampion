# Navigation Changes Documentation

## Overview

The PT Champion web app has been updated to use a top navigation bar instead of a sidebar for desktop layouts. This change improves user experience by providing a more consistent navigation pattern across desktop and mobile views.

## Components Modified

The following components were changed:

1. **DesktopLayout.tsx** - Now uses the new TopNavBar component instead of Sidebar
2. **MobileLayout.tsx** - Has Profile removed from bottom navigation, moved to avatar menu
3. **Sidebar.tsx** - Marked as deprecated (will be removed in future release)

## New Components

1. **TopNavBar.tsx** - New component that provides horizontal navigation in the header
2. **constants/navigation.ts** - Shared navigation configuration used by both layouts

## Architectural Changes

- Navigation items are defined once in `constants/navigation.ts`
- Both layouts share a consistent user menu accessed via the avatar in the top right
- Consistency between desktop and mobile with profile/settings in the user menu only
- The navigation UI is simplified with main navigation in the top bar
- Collapse/expand functionality has been removed (the top bar is always visible)

## Testing

Cypress tests have been updated to work with the new navigation structure. A new test has been added to verify the avatar menu functionality.

## Future Improvements

- The mobile user menu could be further enhanced with additional options
- The navigation constants file could be expanded with more configuration options
- Sidebar.tsx can be completely removed in a future release

## Migration Guide for Developers

If you previously used `Sidebar` in your components, update your imports to use `TopNavBar` instead:

```tsx
// Old way
import Sidebar from '@/components/layout/Sidebar';

// New way
import TopNavBar from '@/components/layout/TopNavBar';
```

For accessing navigation items directly in your code:

```tsx
// Import navigation constants
import { NAV_ITEMS } from '@/constants/navigation';
```
