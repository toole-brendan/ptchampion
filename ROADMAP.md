PT Champion — Detailed Implementation Plan (v0.1 • 18 Apr 2025)

This living plan turns the high‑level roadmap into concrete, time‑boxed work packages. All dates assume a five‑person core team (2 backend, 1 web, 1 Android, 1 iOS) and a fortnightly sprint cadence. Adjust estimates if capacity changes.

Risk & Mitigation

Risk

Impact

Mitigation

Wasm on iOS not production‑ready

Delay shared logic

Maintain Swift port as fallback until iOS 17 ? stabilises

Training data privacy

Legal / PR

Collect only landmarks, store videos opt‑in + purge 30 d

Geo queries cost spike

$$$

Pre‑aggregated H3 buckets + Redis
