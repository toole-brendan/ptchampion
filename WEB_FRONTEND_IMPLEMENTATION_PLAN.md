# PT Champion Web‚ÄëFrontend Implementation Plan

_Last updated: May 15, 2024_

## 1 Purpose
Provide a comprehensive, step‚Äëby‚Äëstep engineering roadmap that will bring the **web** module (React + Vite + Tailwind) to feature and UX parity with the existing iOS and Android apps, while embracing the shared PT Champion Style Guide V2.

---

## 2 Current State Snapshot
| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Project bootstrapped with Vite React TS | ‚úÖ | Basic routing, auth context, shadcn/ui installed |
| Styling aligned to Style Guide V2 | ‚úÖ | Tailwind variables and components match Style Guide V2 |
| Features (Leaderboard, History, Trackers) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Leaderboard complete, Push-up tracker completed with MediaPipe, others pending |
| PWA / Offline | ‚úÖ | Service Worker with caching strategies, IndexedDB for offline data |
| Device integrations (Bluetooth/GPS) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Geolocation for local leaderboards implemented, pose detection implemented |
| Tests & CI | ‚úÖ | GitHub Actions with lint, type check, tests |

---

## 3 Objectives
1. Achieve functional parity with mobile apps for **core features**: Auth, Exercise Tracking & Scoring, History, Leaderboards (global & local).
2. Implement the **Brass‚Äëon‚ÄëCream** design system across all web views.
3. Ship as a high‚Äëquality **Progressive Web App** (installable, offline basics).
4. Ensure maintainability via shared component library and typed API layer.

---

## 4 Assumptions & Constraints
* Single‚Äëpage app (SPA) served by Go backend at `/`.
* Backend endpoints are defined in `openapi.yaml` and considered stable.
* We target Evergreen browsers (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari) + iOS 15+ Safari.
* **No** WebAssembly pose detector ready yet ‚Üî may require TS port or WASM build of `pkg/grading`.
