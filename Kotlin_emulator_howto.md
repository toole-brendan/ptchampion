# PT Champion - Kotlin App Development Status

This document tracks the development progress and outlines the remaining tasks for the PT Champion Android (Kotlin) application.

## How to Run the Kotlin App in Emulator

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK installed
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Android Emulator set up (Pixel 9 Pro recommended)

### Building and Running the App

1. **Build the Kotlin module**:
   ```
   cd PTChampion-Kotlin
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Start the Pixel 9 Pro emulator**:
   ```
   cd $HOME/Library/Android/sdk/emulator
   ./emulator -avd Pixel_9_Pro
   ```
   - This will open the Pixel 9 Pro emulator window

3. **Install the app on the emulator**:
   ```
   cd PTChampion-Kotlin
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

4. **Launch the app**:
   ```
   adb shell am start -n com.example.ptchampion/com.example.ptchampion.ui.MainActivity
   ```

5. **Verify the app is running**:
   - You should see the login screen with email and password fields
   - The app uses a dark theme with a minimalist design

### Troubleshooting

- If the emulator doesn't appear, check if it's running in the background with `adb devices`
- If no devices are connected, restart the emulator
- If the app crashes, check logs with `adb logcat | grep "com.example.ptchampion"`
- If you're having trouble with the build, try `./gradlew clean` then build again
