# Feature Flags Solution Evaluation

## Flagsmith Self-Hosted Evaluation

### Overview
[Flagsmith](https://flagsmith.com/) is an open-source feature flag and remote configuration service that supports both cloud-hosted and self-hosted deployment options. This document evaluates the self-hosted option for PT Champion.

### Requirements
- **Cross-platform support**: Must work with our Go backend, React web app, Android, and iOS clients
- **Performance**: Must have minimal impact on request latency (<20ms overhead)
- **Reliability**: Must continue working if the flag service is temporarily unavailable
- **Cache-aware**: Clients should cache flags to reduce network traffic
- **Targeting**: Support for user/device targeting and gradual rollouts
- **Security**: JWT-compatible authentication
- **Maintainability**: Easy to deploy and manage

### Flagsmith Self-Hosted Evaluation

#### Deployment Options
Flagsmith offers several deployment options:
1. **Docker Compose**: Good for development and small-scale deployments
2. **Kubernetes**: Production-ready using Helm charts
3. **Database Options**: PostgreSQL (recommended), MySQL, or SQLite
4. **Infrastructure Requirements**:
   - API Service: 512MB RAM, 1 vCPU
   - Database: 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU (minimal setup)

#### API Performance
- **Response Time**: <10ms average (measured in a test environment)
- **Caching**: Built-in local caching with configurable TTL
- **Edge Caching**: Supports Redis caching for horizontal scaling

#### Client SDK Availability
Flagsmith provides official SDKs for all our platforms:
- **Backend**: Go SDK available [github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-go-client](https://github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-go-client)
- **Web**: JavaScript/React SDK [github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-js-client](https://github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-js-client)
- **iOS**: Swift SDK [github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-ios-client](https://github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-ios-client)
- **Android**: Kotlin SDK [github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-android-client](https://github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith-android-client)

#### Feature Set
- **Flag Types**: Boolean, string, numeric, JSON
- **Environments**: Dev/staging/prod separation
- **Remote Config**: Values can be tied to flags
- **User Targeting**: Rules based on user attributes
- **Segments**: Group users for targeting
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Percentage-based deployments
- **Analytics**: Track flag usage (requires additional setup)

#### Resilience
- **Offline Mode**: All SDKs support local caching for offline operation
- **Default Values**: Fallback values for unavailable flags
- **Fail Open**: Operations continue even if flag service is down

#### Security & Administration
- **User Roles**: Admin, Editor, Viewer roles
- **Audit Logs**: Changes tracked with user attribution
- **API Authentication**: JWT-compatible API keys
- **SSO Integration**: Available in self-hosted (with some setup)

### Hosting Costs Estimate
- **Infrastructure**: ~$20-40/month for minimal AWS setup (t3.small EC2 + RDS)
- **Maintenance**: Expected 1-2 hours/month for updates and maintenance
- **Alternative**: Cloud-hosted Flagsmith starts at $45/month for 1M monthly API calls

### Implementation Complexity
- **Initial Setup**: 1-2 days for Docker Compose or Kubernetes deployment
- **Backend Integration**: 0.5 day to set up middleware and endpoints
- **Client Integration**: 0.5-1 day per platform for SDK integration
- **Total Estimate**: 3-5 days for complete implementation

### Advantages
- Open-source with active community (7k+ GitHub stars)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Full feature parity with commercial alternatives
- Both hosted and self-hosted options (migration possible)
- Native SDKs for all our platforms

### Disadvantages
- Requires infrastructure management for self-hosted
- Limited analytics compared to commercial offerings
- Community support only (unless Enterprise plan purchased)
- Some advanced features require custom implementation

### Recommendation
Based on evaluation, Flagsmith self-hosted is recommended for PT Champion because:

1. It meets all our technical requirements
2. Provides excellent performance with caching capabilities 
3. Has SDKs for all our platforms
4. The self-hosted option allows full control over the feature flag data
5. Cost is significantly lower than commercial alternatives (LaunchDarkly, Split.io)

### Implementation Plan
1. Deploy Flagsmith using Docker Compose for MVP
2. Migrate to Kubernetes for production if/when necessary
3. Implement flag caching in all clients
4. Create standard flag naming conventions and documentation
5. Set up monitoring for the Flagsmith service

### Alternative Solutions Considered
- **LaunchDarkly**: Fully-featured but expensive (~$150/month minimum)
- **Split.io**: Good offering but pricing starts higher than our needs
- **Custom Solution**: Would require significant development time
- **Unleash**: Good alternative to Flagsmith but slightly less mature SDKs for our platforms
