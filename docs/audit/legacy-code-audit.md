# PT Champion Web Codebase Audit

## Executive Summary

This audit examines the PT Champion web codebase following a significant refactoring that introduced Mediapipe Holistic integration and enhanced the grading logic for exercises. The audit focuses on identifying legacy code, duplicate implementations, and integration issues between old and new codebase components.

## Methodology

The audit performed a systematic analysis of the codebase using the following approaches:
1. Automated code scanning using grep to locate specific patterns
2. Manual inspection of key files and directories
3. Analysis of import relationships and dependency structures

## Key Findings

### 1. Legacy Code References

#### 1-A. Inventory Results

1. **Imports from backup folder**:
   - ✅ No direct imports from the backup folder were found
   - Command: `grep -R "from .*backup" -n src`

2. **Manual MediaPipe initialization**:
   - ✅ No instances of direct MediaPipe initialization (`new PoseLandmarker`) in pages/components
   - Command: `grep -R "new PoseLandmarker" -n src/pages src/components`

3. **Deprecated usePoseDetector hook**:
   - ⚠️ The hook is defined in src/lib/hooks/usePoseDetector.ts
   - ⚠️ Only used in backup components (not in active codebase):
     ```
     src/backup/PushupTracker.tsx:111
     src/backup/SitupTracker.tsx:66
     src/backup/PullupTracker.tsx:71
     ```

4. **Duplicated angle/threshold constants**:
   - ⚠️ Duplicated threshold constants found in tracker pages:
     ```
     src/pages/exercises/PushupTracker.tsx - PUSHUP_THRESHOLD_ANGLE_DOWN, PUSHUP_THRESHOLD_ANGLE_UP
     src/pages/exercises/SitupTracker.tsx - SITUP_THRESHOLD_ANGLE_DOWN, SITUP_THRESHOLD_ANGLE_UP
     ```
   - These should be centralized in their respective analyzer/grader files

### 2. Naming Inconsistencies and Integration Issues

#### 2-A. PushupGrader vs PushupAnalyzer

- **Issue**: The grading/index.ts references PushupGrader, but implementation appears to be PushupAnalyzer
  - `grading/index.ts` imports and uses PushupGrader
  - `viewmodels/PushupTrackerViewModel.ts` imports and uses PushupAnalyzer

- **Related files**:
  - src/grading/PushupAnalyzer.ts (exists and is used)
  - src/components/PushupAnalyzerDemo.tsx (uses PushupAnalyzer)
  - src/components/PushupFormVisualizer.tsx (uses PushupFormAnalysis from PushupAnalyzer)
  - src/viewmodels/PushupTrackerViewModel.ts (uses PushupAnalyzer)

- This indicates a potential naming inconsistency between the index file and the actual implementation, or a missing file.

### 3. Backup Directory Assessment

- The backup directory contains previous versions of tracker components:
  - PushupTracker.tsx (26KB)
  - SitupTracker.tsx (20KB)
  - PullupTracker.tsx (23KB)
  - RunningTracker.tsx (21KB)
  - index.tsx (4.6KB)

- These files appear to be using the older implementation style with the deprecated usePoseDetector hook

### 4. Current Exercise Trackers

- The current exercise trackers in src/pages/exercises/ have similar or larger file sizes compared to their backup counterparts:
  - PushupTracker.tsx (30KB, 719 lines) vs backup (26KB, 701 lines)
  - SitupTracker.tsx (28KB, 660 lines) vs backup (20KB, 573 lines)
  - PullupTracker.tsx (28KB, 640 lines) vs backup (23KB, 624 lines)
  - RunningTracker.tsx (22KB, 539 lines) vs backup (21KB, 568 lines)

- This suggests that while some refactoring has occurred, substantial portions of the legacy implementation logic may still be present within the current files.

## Recommendations

### 1. Code Cleanup & Standardization

1. **Verify and fix naming inconsistencies**:
   - Resolve the PushupGrader vs PushupAnalyzer discrepancy
   - Ensure naming is consistent across all exercise types

2. **Centralize constants**:
   - Move all threshold angles and constants to the respective analyzer/grader files
   - Reference these constants from the UI components

3. **Remove duplicated code**:
   - Remove duplicate angle calculation functions
   - Use the centralized math utilities

### 2. Architecture Improvements

1. **Standardize analyzer/grader implementation**:
   - Ensure all exercise types follow the same architectural pattern
   - Confirm proper integration between UI components and the analyzer/grader implementations

2. **Cleanup backup folder**:
   - After verifying all functionality is properly migrated, remove the backup folder
   - Add a check to CI to prevent accidental imports from backup folders

### 3. Testing & Documentation

1. **Test exercise tracking**:
   - Verify that all exercise types function correctly with the new implementation
   - Ensure rep counting, form analysis, and scoring work as expected

2. **Update documentation**:
   - Document the new architecture and integration points
   - Provide component diagrams showing the relationship between UI components and grading logic

## Next Steps

1. Address the findings in priority order:
   - Fix naming inconsistencies and missing files
   - Centralize constants and remove duplicate code
   - Complete migration of any remaining legacy logic
   - Remove backup folder once migration is complete and tested

2. Implement automated checks to prevent regression:
   - Add linting rules to enforce architectural patterns
   - Add tests to verify exercise tracking functionality
