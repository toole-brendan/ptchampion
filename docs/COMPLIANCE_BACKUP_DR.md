# PT Champion: Compliance, Backup, and Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the compliance frameworks, data backup strategies, and disaster recovery procedures implemented for the PT Champion application ecosystem.

## 1. Compliance Framework

### 1.1 Regulatory Compliance

PT Champion handles personal fitness data, which requires adherence to the following regulations:

| Regulation | Applicability | Implementation |

| HIPAA | Not directly applicable | Following best practices voluntarily |
| COPPA | Not targeting children | Age verification in registration flow |

### 1.2 Data Protection Principles

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for the application's core functionality
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
3. **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only as long as necessary
4. **Accuracy**: Provide mechanisms for users to update their data
5. **Integrity & Confidentiality**: Protect data through encryption and access controls

### 1.3 User Rights Management

| Right | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| Right to Access | Self-service profile with export functionality |
| Right to Rectification | Edit profile feature |
| Right to Erasure | Account deletion flow with data purge |
| Right to Restriction | Ability to pause data collection |
| Right to Data Portability | Export functionality in standard formats (JSON, CSV) |
| Right to Object | Marketing opt-out, data processing controls |

### 1.4 Privacy Impact Assessment

1. **Data Collection Points**:
   - User registration (email, name)
   - Fitness metrics (exercise performance, heart rate)
   - Device data (camera for pose detection)
   - Location data (for local leaderboards, optional)

2. **Data Processing Activities**:
   - Exercise form analysis
   - Performance tracking and history
   - Leaderboard rankings
   - Personalized recommendations

3. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Data anonymization for analytics
   - Secure transmission protocols
   - Regular security audits

## 2. Data Backup Strategy

### 2.1 Database Backup Approach

| PostgreSQL Database | Point-in-Time Recovery | Continuous | 35 days |
| PostgreSQL Database | Full Logical Backup | Weekly | 90 days |
| Redis Cache | Snapshot | Daily | 7 days |
| User-Generated Content | S3 Versioning | Continuous | Indefinite |

### 2.2 Backup Storage Strategy

| Storage | Lifecycle | Encryption | Cross-Region |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| S3 Standard | 0-30 days | SSE-KMS | No |
| S3 IA | 31-90 days | SSE-KMS | Yes (DR region) |
| S3 Glacier | 91+ days | SSE-KMS | Yes (DR region) |

### 2.3 Backup Testing Schedule

| Test Type | Frequency | Responsible Team | Verification Method |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Database Restore Test | Quarterly | DevOps | Restore to isolated environment, verify data integrity |
| Partial Restore Test | Monthly | DevOps | Restore specific tables or objects |
| DR Readiness Test | Semi-annually | DevOps & Engineering | Full recovery exercise |

### 2.4 Backup Monitoring and Alerting

- Automated monitoring for backup job status

- Monitoring for backup storage consumption
- Quarterly backup audit report

## 3. Disaster Recovery Plan

### 3.1 DR Strategy Overview

PT Champion implements a Warm Standby disaster recovery approach with the following components:

1. **Primary Region**: US-West-2 (Oregon)
2. **DR Region**: US-East-1 (Virginia)
3. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 1 hour
4. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 5 minutes
5. **DR Testing Schedule**: Quarterly

### 3.2 Disaster Scenarios and Responses

| Scenario | Detection | Response | Recovery |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Region Outage** | AWS Health Dashboard, CloudWatch Alarms | Initiate region failover | Activate DR environment in secondary region |
| **Database Corruption** | Data integrity checks, Error monitoring | Stop writes, isolate issue | Restore from latest viable backup |
| **Cybersecurity Incident** | Security monitoring, Unusual activity | Engage incident response team | Isolate affected systems, restore from clean backups |
| **Application Failure** | Health checks, Error rate monitoring | Rollback deployment | Deploy previous stable version |

### 3.3 DR Infrastructure Components

- **Database**: Cross-region read replica for PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Cross-region Redis replication
- **Application**: Multi-region ECS task definitions
- **Static Assets**: Cross-region S3 replication
- **DNS**: Route 53 health checks and failover routing
- **Data Synchronization**: DMS for database, S3 replication for objects

### 3.4 Failover Process

1. **Decision to Failover**:
   - Automated triggers based on health metrics
   - Manual authorization for non-automated scenarios

2. **Execution Steps**:
   - Promote read replica to primary in DR region
   - Update connection strings in application configuration
   - Switch Route 53 DNS to point to DR environment
   - Scale up ECS services in DR region

3. **Validation**:
   - Execute automated health checks
   - Perform manual validation of critical flows
   - Verify data consistency

4. **Return to Normal**:
   - After primary region issues are resolved
   - Synchronize any data changes back to primary
   - Execute gradual traffic shift back to primary

### 3.5 DR Runbook

The detailed DR procedures are maintained in the Operations Runbook with the following sections:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Assessment team assembly
   - Initial impact evaluation
   - Communication protocols activation

2. **Recovery Execution**:
   - Technical procedures for each DR scenario
   - Role-specific responsibilities
   - Detailed command sequences

3. **Validation**:
   - Service verification checklist
   - Data integrity verification steps
   - Performance baseline comparison

4. **Documentation**:
   - Event timeline recording
   - Decision log
   - Improvement opportunities identification

## 4. Data Governance and Retention
