# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Guide for PT Champion

## Overview

This document outlines how Model Context Protocol (MCP) can be integrated with PT Champion to enhance the application's capabilities through AI-powered interactions. MCP allows large language models (LLMs) like Claude, GPT-4, and others to access external tools, APIs, and data sources through well-defined function calling interfaces.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is a framework that enables AI language models to:

1. **Interact with external systems** through defined function interfaces
2. **Parse and manipulate structured data** beyond simple text generation
3. **Perform complex workflows** by chaining multiple tool calls together
4. **Access real-time data sources** for up-to-date information
5. **Take actions** on behalf of users with appropriate permissions

## How MCP Can Enhance PT Champion

### 1. Personalized Workout Analysis and Coaching

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Example MCP function definition
interface WorkoutAnalysisFunction {
  name: "analyze_workout";
  description: "Analyzes user workout data and provides personalized feedback";
  parameters: {
    workout_id: string;
    user_id: string;
    exercise_type: "push_ups" | "pull_ups" | "sit_ups" | "running";
  };
  returns: {
    feedback: string;
    improvement_areas: string[];
    suggested_exercises: Exercise[];
  };
}
```

This function would:
- Retrieve the user's exercise data (including form analysis from MediaPipe)
- Generate personalized feedback based on performance
- Identify specific areas for improvement
- Suggest complementary exercises tailored to the user's goals

### 2. Enhanced Form Analysis with AI Coaching

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface FormAnalysisFunction {
  name: "analyze_exercise_form";
  description: "Analyzes exercise form from video data and provides real-time feedback";
  parameters: {
    exercise_type: string;
    pose_landmarks: PoseLandmark[]; // MediaPipe data
    user_height: number; // cm
    user_weight: number; // kg
    fitness_level: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
  };
  returns: {
    form_score: number; // 0-100
    real_time_feedback: string;
    correction_suggestions: string[];
    injury_risk_areas: string[];
  };
}
```

Benefits:
- Real-time form correction beyond simple counting
- Personalized advice based on body type and fitness level
- Injury prevention insights
- Progress tracking for form improvement

### 3. Adaptive Fitness Program Generation

```typescript
interface GenerateTrainingProgramFunction {
  name: "generate_training_program";
  description: "Creates a personalized training program based on user data and goals";
  parameters: {
    user_id: string;
    goal: "strength" | "endurance" | "military_test_prep" | "weight_loss";
    available_equipment: string[];
    time_available_per_day: number; // minutes
    days_available_per_week: number;
    current_fitness_metrics: UserMetrics;
  };
  returns: {
    program: TrainingProgram;
    progression_plan: ProgressionMilestone[];
    expected_timeline: string;
  };
}
```

This would create fully personalized training programs that:
- Adapt to user's available equipment and time constraints
- Focus on specific military fitness test requirements
- Provide clear progression plans
- Adjust based on actual performance data

### 4. Natural Language Query Interface for Progress Data

```typescript
interface QueryUserProgressFunction {
  name: "query_progress_data";
  description: "Allows natural language queries about user fitness progress";
  parameters: {
    user_id: string;
    query: string; // Natural language query
    time_range?: {
      start_date: string;
      end_date: string;
    };
  };
  returns: {
    answer: string;
    supporting_data: any; // Could be metrics, charts, etc.
    suggestions: string[];
  };
}
```

This enables users to ask questions like:
- "How has my push-up form improved over the last month?"
- "What's my weakest exercise type right now?"
- "Am I on track to meet my fitness test goal next month?"
- "Compare my performance to others in my age/weight class"

### 5. Smart Leaderboard Insights

```typescript
interface LeaderboardInsightsFunction {
  name: "analyze_leaderboard_position";
  description: "Provides insights on user's leaderboard position and improvement strategies";
  parameters: {
    user_id: string;
    leaderboard_id: string;
    comparison_group?: "global" | "local" | "unit" | "age_group";
  };
  returns: {
    current_ranking: number;
    percentile: number;
    key_differentiators: {
      exercise: string;
      user_performance: number;
      top_performers_average: number;
      improvement_potential: number;
    }[];
    strategic_advice: string;
  };
}
```

This would provide users with:
- Understanding of their competitive position
- Specific exercises where they most lag behind competitors
- Strategic advice for improving rank
- Realistic goals for advancement

### 6. Bluetooth Device Troubleshooting Assistant

```typescript
interface TroubleshootDeviceFunction {
  name: "troubleshoot_bluetooth_device";
  description: "Helps users resolve issues with connected fitness devices";
  parameters: {
    device_type: string;
    device_model: string;
    error_code?: string;
    symptom_description: string;
    os_type: "iOS" | "Android" | "Web";
    os_version: string;
  };
  returns: {
    possible_causes: string[];
    troubleshooting_steps: TroubleshootingStep[];
    contact_support?: SupportInfo;
  };
}
```

This would assist users with:
- Connecting Bluetooth heart rate monitors
- Troubleshooting GPS watch integration issues
- Resolving data sync problems
- Device compatibility verification

## Implementation Architecture

To integrate MCP effectively in PT Champion:

1. **Backend Function Registry**:
   - Create a registry of MCP-compatible functions in the Go backend

   - Implement caching for expensive operations
   - Add observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Create React hooks for MCP function calling
   - Build UI components for displaying MCP function results
   - Implement client-side caching for common queries

## Security Considerations

When implementing MCP for PT Champion:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Ensure all MCP functions validate user permissions
   - Implement rate limiting for API-intensive operations
   - Use scoped tokens for function-specific access

2. **Data Privacy**:
   - Only send necessary data to AI systems
   - Anonymize personal information where possible
   - Respect user privacy preferences

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Thoroughly validate all input parameters
   - Implement schema validation for all function calls
   - Protect against injection attacks in natural language inputs

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement basic MCP functions for workout analysis and form feedback
2. **Phase 2**: Add personalized training program generation
