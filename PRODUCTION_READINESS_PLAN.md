## 1. Core Principles
- **Automation first:** every repetitive task (tests, lint, build, deploy, infra) must run via CI/CD.
- **Security by default:** least‑privilege IAM, secrets management, SAST/DAST, SBOM, dependency scanning.
- **Observability:** logs, metrics, traces, uptime & performance dashboards.
- **Fail fast:** comprehensive test coverage and feature‑flag driven rollouts.
