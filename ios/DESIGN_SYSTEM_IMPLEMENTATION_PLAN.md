# Design System Implementation Plan


Create a centralized, automated styling system that:
- Uses `design-tokens.json` as the single source of truth-- (PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IOS IS NOT THE PROJECT ROOT -- IOS IS ONE MODULE OF BIGGER PROJECT THAT IS THE ROOT WHERE THE DESIGN TOKENS AND CENTRAL SOURCE OF TRUTH ARE.)
- Automatically propagates token changes throughout the application (INCLUDING TO IOS MODULE, WHICH WE ARE WORKING ON NOW)
- Provides proper module boundaries and clear imports
- Maintains high code quality and compilation performance
- Supports all required components and styling needs
